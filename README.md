## My statement about this project
Regarding this project, my primary focus is to produce detailed documentation explaining how to build a C# Minecraft Launcher. 
I intend to continue working on the launcher's development once my other current projects are finalized. 
Furthermore, I am exploring the possibility of a full rewrite, which would involve leveraging alternative technologies.
